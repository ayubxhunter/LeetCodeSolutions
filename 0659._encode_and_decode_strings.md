> Description

```
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement encode and decode

Example 1:

Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]

Output:["neet","code","love","you"]
Example 2:

Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]

Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]
```

```python
class Solution:

    def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:

        res = ""

        for s in strs:
            res += str(len(s)) + "#" + s
        return res

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        de = []
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            j = i
            while s[j] != "#":
                j += 1
            
            length = int(s[i:j])
            
            de.append(s[j+1:j+1+length])
            
            i = j + 1 + length
        
        return de
```
