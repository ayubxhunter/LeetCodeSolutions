Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Statement

> Description

```
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
```

## Solutions

> Approach 1
******- Time Complexity: O(n)******- Space Complexity: O(1)******

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        l = len(nums)
        answer = [1] * l

        left_product = 1
        for  i in range(l):
            answer[i] = left_product
            left_product *= nums[i]

        right_prod = 1
        for i in range(l - 1, -1, -1):
            answer[i] *= right_prod
            right_prod *= nums[i]
        
        return answer
```
