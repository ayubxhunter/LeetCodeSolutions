> Description

```

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Solutions

> Approach 1
******- Time Complexity: O(n)******- Space Complexity: O(n)******

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        dic = {}

        for i in range(len(nums)):

            looking = target - nums[i]

            if looking in dic:
                return [dic[looking], i]
            
            dic[nums[i]] = i
```


> Approach 2
******- Time Complexity: O(n^2)******- Space Complexity: O(1)******

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]
